# FunkE Random Password Generator 

## Description

The purpose of this webpage is to assist user in creating a password generated by the computer. The user can choose parameters they would like in their password and the computer will generate a unique password that follows those parameters. This can help users enhance their security throughout their life by recieving a uniques output each time. I was able tp deepen my learning on for loops and functions in JavaScript. I learned I have more skills to gain and will need more practice with JavaScript. I have a hard time over thinking which of my variables connect in what sequcial order.
